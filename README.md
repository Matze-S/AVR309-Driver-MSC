# AVR309-Driver-MSC
Windows kernel driver for USBtiny / AVR309 USB controller, based on Atmel's AVR309 application note

The attached and SIGNED Windows Kernel driver of the AVR309 application note for x86/x64 might be useful.

Unfortunately, I can no longer afford a code signing certificate, so changes are only possible to a limited extent (dll), but thanks to the author of the AN309, they are rarely necessary. :-)

However, a bug fix still had to be applied, if you are interested, please differentiate and understand it yourself - I can't (and don't want to) remember those good times back then. :(
